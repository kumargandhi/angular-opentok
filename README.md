# Angular opentok

#### Sample Angular application to work with opentok for video chatting and archiving.

>This example is based on samples at [opentok-angular](http://github.com/aullman/opentok-angular).

### Running the App

#### Setting your OpenTok apiKey, sessionId and token

Before you can run this application you need to modify [config.ts](src/config.ts) and include your OpenTok API Key, Session ID and a valid token. For more details on how to get these values see [Token creation
overview](https://tokbox.com/opentok/tutorials/create-token/).

>I would recommend reading from here and trying the Hello World [Quick start](https://tokbox.com/developer/quickstart/)

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
